For security reasons, the password reset email is sent to the email address on record in the user's portal.ul.com account.  As long as the email address is not shared, you are the only one who received the temporary password.  You will be required to change your password immediately upon logging in with the temporary password.  A temporary password will expire if it is not used within 90 days.</p>

			<p>There are several reasons for this error:</p>

				<li>If you changed your password after bookmarking a sub-page of the site, you will need to remove the bookmark and access the portal via portal.ul.com.</li>
				<li>If you changed the password after choosing the "Remember my password" feature in your browser, disable the "Remember my password" feature</li>
