    <h4>COUNTRY-SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS</h4>
    <p>The Site is hosted by UL from the United States. UL makes no representation that the Site is appropriate or available for use at other locations outside of the United States. Access to the Site from territories where the Site's content is illegal is prohibited. If you access the Site from a location outside of the United States, you are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. You may not use the Site or export information and materials in violation of the export laws of the United States or any other country.</p>
    <h4>GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h4>
    <p>These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, United States of America, without reference to its choice of law principles.  Subject to the below dispute resolution provision, and without limiting its scope, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction in the state courts and federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Cook County, Illinois or the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, for any claims or disputes that are determined not to be subject to resolution by arbitration, as provided in the dispute resolution provision below.</p>
    <h4>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h4>
    <p>Any dispute or disagreement relating to these Terms will be settled by confidential, binding arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") pursuant to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes. The arbitration venue will be Chicago, Illinois, except: (i) if your principal place of business is in Europe, then the venue will be London, UK; and (ii) if your principal place of business is in Asia, Australia or New Zealand, then the venue will be Singapore, Republic of Singapore.  The arbitration will be conducted before a panel of three (3) arbitrators.  Each arbitrator will be an individual with substantial commercial transactional experience of at least fifteen (15) years in a corporate or judicial legal setting.  The arbitration panel will be selected as follows:  you and UL will request a list of ten (10) arbitrators drawn from the AAA's panel of commercial arbitrators (to be experienced in and familiar with the AAA's Procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes).  From this list, both parties will each choose one arbitrator. After they have been notified of their panel selection, the two (2) arbitrators will agree on a third arbitrator from the list of ten (10), who will be the chair of the panel, and the panel will be final. The decision of the majority of the arbitrators will be the panel's decision.   The arbitrators will not have the authority to add change, or disregard any provision in these Terms, award incidental, consequential, or punitive damages (including, but not limited to, loss of use, unjust enrichment, and/or lost profits), or exceed the limitation of liability provided for above.  The panel's decision will be binding and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Arbitration will be the final remedy for any dispute between us arising out of these Terms, provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent UL from seeking a court order such as for injunctive relief (in addition to other remedies) to stop or prevent misuse or misappropriation of its trademarks, confidential or proprietary information, or infringement of its intellectual property, in a court of law.  All arbitrations shall be conducted in English.</p>
    <h4>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h4>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and UL and governs your use of the Site, superseding any prior version of these Terms between you and UL with respect to the Services and Site. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. For purposes of clarity, the UL Terms of Use located at <a href="http://www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/corporate/onlinepolicies/termsofuse/" target="_blank">http://www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/corporate/onlinepolicies/termsofuse/</a> do not apply to this Site.</p>
    <h4>SEPARATE AGREEMENTS</h4>
    <p>You may have other agreements with UL or its affiliates or subsidiaries not relating to your use of the Site.  Those agreements are separate and in addition to these Terms.  These Terms do not modify, revise or amend the terms of any other agreements you may have with UL that do not relate to your use of the Site.  Please review the terms of those other agreements as they govern your relationship with UL and the services that may be provided by UL through this Site.</p>
    <h4>STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</h4>
    <p>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
    <h4>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY OF TERMS</h4>
    <p>The failure of UL to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.</p>
